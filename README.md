**Created to optimize rodent injection workflow**

Previously, our lab would individually label each syringe with a piece of tape, then keep them in a standard vertical syringe rack before filling each syringe according to the dose for each rodent. We would then lay the syringes down on the worksurface in the order of injections. This process was tedious and had room for improvement. I designed this horizontal syringe rack so that we could more easily keep track of the ID of each syringe, maintain sterility by keeping the needles further above the work surface, and to help stay organized, which is especially hard when you need to quickly inject a large number of rodents in a row.

Our studies usually identifies rodents based on their sex (M or F) and a number. To give an example, in the case of our current study we have 32 in rats total (16 of each sex) group housed two to each cage and number them M1, M2, F1, F2, M3, M4, F3, F4,... M15, M16, F15, F16 which is also the order they'll be injected which correlates to the IDs on the syringe racks. The files labeled Rack #1 - Rack #5 use this system of identification. These racks are in a folder titled "Sex & # ID Racks"

I've also included a design with normal numbering, up to 28 slots, and a blank design with no numbers at all.

The shape of the slots was designed to fit a 1mL BD Brand Luer-Lok syringe, but they also will fit a 5mL syringe!

Although the design is my own, some designs I found online while researching were definitely inspiring including one from cults3d.com: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/home/stackable-parametric-syringe-rack

After realizing the originals were not tall enough to prevent the needle from touching the work surface, I have doubled the height of the racks. See the folder titled "Updated Taller Racks".

The syringe racks have made injections go very smoothly and my lab and I have been using them for the past few weeks! Below are some pictures of the racks with syringes. As you can see in the second image, the racks make it very easy to verify that each syringe has the correct volume!
