Created to optimize rodent injection workflow. Previously, our lab would individually label each syringe with a piece of tape, then keep them in a standard verticle syringe rack before filling each syringe according to the dose for each rodent. We would then lay the syringes down on the worksurface in the order of injections. This process was tedious and had room for improvement. I designed this horizontal syringe rack so that we could more easily keep track of the ID of each syringe, maintain sterility by keeping the needles further above the work surface, and to help stay organized which is especially hard when injecting a large number of rodents all in a row.

Our studys usually identifies rodents based on their sex (M or F) and a number. To give an example, in the case of our current study we have 32 rats total (16 of each sex) group housed two to each cage and number them M1, M2, F1, F2, M3, M4, F3, F4,... M15, M16, F15, F16 which is also the order they'll be injected which correlates to the IDs on the syringe racks. The files labelled Rack #1 - Rack #5 use this system of identification.

I've also included a design with normal numbering, up to 28 slots, and a blank desing with no numbers at all.
